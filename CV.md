> This is an endorsement for Bryan Gilbert who I worked with while Manager of IT at Carmanah Technologies. Bryan and I worked together on some great projects. The fact that they ranged across Engineering, Customer Services, Sales and Marketing, etc. gives you an idea of Bryan’s terrific versatility. Bryan is a solution provider over software developer. He clarifies the business need, always keeps efficiency/usability/scalability at the forefront of his work, and has a deep understanding of the software development process. The ideas sessions we had were some of the liveliest and most enjoyable I have been involved in. Bryan is continuously adding new skills to his portfolio (e.g. Salesforce certification) and mentoring others. I would jump at the chance to work with Bryan again and advise you to do the same

> I am writing this recommendation for any person or company seeking Bryan's software development or leadership 
expertise. Quite simply Bryan is one of the most talented, capable, and balanced developers I have ever had the 
opportunity to work with. I managed Brian as a member of a 12 person core team to deliver Oracle E-Business Suite 
to a Victoria based solar engineering firm. Specifically Bryan led part of the initiative that dealt with how 
Oracle interfaced with some of the existing systems. During planning we encountered many challenges but Bryan 
consistently came up with innovative ways to overcome those barriers and delivered prototypes very quickly for 
testing. Simply put the project would not likely have been a success if it were not for Bryan's help. 
In short if you have have the opportunity to seek Brian's assistance with a project or future employment don't 
hesitate.

> I highly recommend Bryan as an excellent senior software developer and team leader. With his wealth of experience, 
Bryan shows a strong understanding of effective architectural and design concepts as well as the means of achieving 
any tricky implementation problem a project may come across. During my time working with Bryan, I benefited greatly 
from his leadership and mentoring skills and was able to more effectively grow my own skills. Also, without his 
project/time management magic, hitting our milestones would have been hopeless. His value as a lead software 
designer/developer is undeniable.
