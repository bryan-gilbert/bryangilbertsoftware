## Project: React in a day
- 2018, 1 day
- Objective: Complete an assignment within 24 hours to demonstrate technical ability.
- Situation: The assignment required React.  Unfortunately, Bryan had no exposure or experience
with React or the React environment. He could've declined the assignment but instead he took the challenge to
not only do the assignment within the time period but to learn React too.  React is considered a moderately 
difficult system to learn and most say to allow several weeks to gain basic proficiency.
- Position Outcomes:
    - Learned how to create, develop and deploy a React application (with Babel and Webpack).
    - Make API calls to retrieve data from other sites
    - React work completed on time. Provided a complete installable open source repository with the results:
