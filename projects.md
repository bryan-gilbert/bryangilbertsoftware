## Project: React in a day
> Learns new technologies quickly and accurately

- 2018, 1 day
- Objective: Complete an assignment within 24 hours to demonstrate technical ability.

    - Learned how to create, develop and deploy a React application (with Babel and Webpack).
    - Make API calls to retrieve data from other sites
    - React work completed on time. Provided a complete installable open source repository with the results:
