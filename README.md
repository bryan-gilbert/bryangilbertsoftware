# A CV for Bryan Gilbert

> Full Stack DevOps

This github repository was born from the need refactor my resume from the traditional format that lists
the companies one worked for into a format that is focused on projects. This format uses a lot of lists and that
suggested using markdown like we use in git repositories.  Since all of the information in my resume is visible in my 
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryangilbertsoftware) 
profile so I asked why not create a public repo with my CV using markdown.  See the contents of CV.md.
