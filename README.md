# CV

> a CV for Bryan Gilbert, B.Sc.(Hon), M.Sc. -- a full stack DevSecOps developer


This github repository was born from the need refactor my resume from the traditional format that lists
the companies one worked for into a format that is focused on projects. This format uses a lot of lists and that
suggested using markdown like we use in git repositories.  Since all of the information in my resume is visible in my 
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryangilbertsoftware) 
profile it seemed reasonable to make a public repo with my CV using markdown.
